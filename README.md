# Calculator
A functioning calculator capable of perform basic calculating functions such as sum, substract, multiply, and divide. Also performs more complex tasks such as power and log functions.

<h1>Before starting the project</h1>
I expect to implement everything I've learned so far through The Odin Project. Meaning I will use html to structure the information that is displayed on it. CSS to design a calculator and implement other features common to every website, all of this mostly with flexbox. Finally, javascript to render the calculator functional. As the calculator will have many buttons, I expect the complexity of the project to be high as it will be necessary work with a higher amount of information than the one I'm used to at the moment due to previous projects.
