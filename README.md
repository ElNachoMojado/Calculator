# Calculator
A functioning calculator capable of perform basic calculating functions such as sum, substract, multiply, and divide.

<h1>Before starting the project</h1>
I expect to implement everything I've learned so far through The Odin Project. Meaning I will use html to structure the information that is displayed on it. CSS to design a calculator and implement other features common to every website, all of this mostly with flexbox. Finally, javascript to render the calculator functional. As the calculator will have many buttons, I expect the complexity of the project to be high as it will be necessary work with a higher amount of information than the one I'm used to at the moment due to previous projects.

<h2>Learnings</h2>
Making a calculator was not as easy as I thought it would be. I spent two days thinking of a strategy to make it accept two numbers and <strong>JUST</strong> add them. When I finally had a working version that could add two numbers it wasn't too difficult adapting that to the different operations. From then the next challenge was to allow the calculator to accept multidigit numbers. In the end, my calculator allows the user to write the desired calculation. The calculator reads the input and converts it into an array that it then evaluates two numbers (one operation) at a time instead of the whole operation at once.
  <ul>
    <li>Better understanding of arrays</li>
    <li>Patience and perseverance to keep thinking of strategies and get the work done as best as possible</li>
    <li>CSS position</li>
    <li>Use web developer tools to debug code</li>
  </ul>
